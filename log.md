# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 29, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** The CodeCamp stuff was relatively straight forward. I'm breezing through the first part but I know it will get more challenging from here.

### Day 2: January 30, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Accessibility lessons for Codecademy, Finished FreeCodeCamp HTML/CSS section, finished Codecademy assignment for Users

**Thoughts**: There are some things I never thought of in regards to accessibility but this UI/UX class through Codecademy has opened my eyes to things like the Web Content Accessibility Guide (which I will be taking a look at)

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
