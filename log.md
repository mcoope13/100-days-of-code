# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 29, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** The CodeCamp stuff was relatively straight forward. I'm breezing through the first part but I know it will get more challenging from here.

### Day 2: January 30, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Accessibility lessons for Codecademy, Finished FreeCodeCamp HTML/CSS section, finished Codecademy assignment for Users

**Thoughts**: There are some things I never thought of in regards to accessibility but this UI/UX class through Codecademy has opened my eyes to things like the Web Content Accessibility Guide (which I will be taking a look at)

### Day 4: February 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did some work on FreeCodeCamp but I also did some UX/UI course on Codecademy

**Thoughts** I feel like if I'm going to work on Bootstrap I really need to buckle down or download an eBook so I can make sense of it. It's such an important thing, I need to dedicate a lot of time to it.

### Day 6: February 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did some Javascript work on Udacity again.

**Thoughts** I did a WHILE Loop on the first try for a FizzBuzz type quiz but while I was doing another one I couldn't quite get it. I think it's because 1 evaluates to true but it's challenge.
