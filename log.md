# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did an hour of work on Jonas Schmedtmann's HTML and CSS Udemy Course.

**Thoughts** I did a WHILE Loop on the first try for a FizzBuzz type quiz but while I was doing another one I couldn't quite get it. I think it's because 1 evaluates to true but it's challenge.

### Day 2: April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did some more work on Jonas Schmedtmann's HTML and CSS Udemy Course. It was a lot about jQuery and building a sticky navigation using jQuery.

**Thoughts** jQuery is a lot easier than I thought it would be, but it also demands very exacting attenion to detail. Damn you semicolons!
