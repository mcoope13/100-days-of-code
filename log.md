**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** The CodeCamp stuff was relatively straight forward. I'm breezing through the first part but I know it will get more challenging from here.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
